# TLM Reader Documentation

For the time being the documentation for the library will be kept in source within this folder. As the library project matures to use in an application it may become necessary for a more robust documentation method.

## Byte Format

The format for how the bytes are laid out in a TLM file is outlined [here](byteFormat.md).
